### Some context about programming journey

In 2022, I completed my 12th grade and was ready to join a college. I prepared for an entrance exam and got decent marks to get into a decent college. I joined JIIT Noida in September 2022; left it in December 2022 due to some reasons 

At the start of 2023, I joined an online [degree](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds) program, and looked forward to improving my skillset.
I was introduced to [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) and this was a game changing moment in my programming journey and this was my 2023.

Around February 2024, I got introduced to Functional Programming, and finally decided to go with **Haskell**. I plan to write another blog for this language. 

### Some context about job applications

During 2023, I applied at Internshala, which was a very bad experience for me. There were no replies from any of the companies.
I started applying to big-tech companies, but I didn't even get a reply. I got to know that there is a thing called *University Hiring*. I am a student of an online degree, so this was not for me. I was hugely disappointed.

I got introduced to **Wellfound**, possibly the best place to apply as you will get to work in startups and at least they reply (you can filter the responsive companies)

I was accepted in few startups, as a first step they give a assessment, which is basically making a mini project but just in 48  hours deadline.
At least I had a closure, that I was not accepted because my project submission was not good !

### Pazy to the rescue

I applied to [pazy.io](https://pazy.io) despite in their job listing description "Only for 7th/8th semester students". Luckily I was shortlisted in first round, and I had an short interview on call. I was scheduled with the first round interview :)

First round interview was about **Project Discussion**. The recruiter was in slight doubt, but I got the green light for second round interview.

Second round interview was about **Technical Discussion**. Thankfully, the recruiter also don't really believe in *DSA*, so I was lucky again.
He asked me questions about HTTP, Concurrency, System Design and etc. 

2 days later, I had on boarding call !
I was offered a 3 month internship starting from 25 November 2024

### Kickstarting at Pazy

I was really nervous. Its my first time working *professionally*. I started using the following things for the first time

- VSCode Git Client
- Slack
- Jira
- Confluence
- DBeave/ DataGrip
