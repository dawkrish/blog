### Some context about programming journey

In 2022, I completed my 12th grade and was ready to join a college. I prepared for an entrance exam and got decent marks to get into a decent college. I joined JIIT Noida in September 2022; left it in December 2022 due to some reasons 

At the start of 2023, I joined an online [degree](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds) program, and looked forward to improving my skillset.
I was introduced to [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) and this was a game changing moment in my programming journey and this was my 2023.

Around February 2024, I got introduced to Functional Programming, and finally decided to go with **Haskell**. I plan to write another blog for this language. 

### Some context about job applications

During 2023, I applied at Internshala, which was a very bad experience for me. There were no replies from any of the companies.
I started applying to big-tech companies, but I didn't even get a reply. I got to know that there is a thing called *University Hiring*. I am a student of an online degree, so this was not for me. I was hugely disappointed.

I got introduced to **Wellfound**, possibly the best place to apply as you will get to work in startups and at least they reply (you can filter the responsive companies)

I was accepted in few startups, as a first step they give a assessment, which is basically making a mini project but just in 48  hours deadline.
At least I had a closure, that I was not accepted because my project submission was not good !

### Pazy to the rescue

I applied to [Pazy](https://pazy.io) despite in their job listing description "Only for 7th/8th semester students". Luckily I was shortlisted in first round, and I had an short interview on call. I was scheduled with the first round interview :)

First round interview was about **Project Discussion**. The recruiter was in slight doubt, but I got the green light for second round interview.

Second round interview was about **Technical Discussion**. Thankfully, the recruiter also don't really believe in *DSA*, so I was lucky again.
He asked me questions about HTTP, Concurrency, System Design and etc. 

2 days later, I had on boarding call !
I was offered a 3 month internship starting from 25 November 2024

### Kickstarting at Pazy

I was really nervous. Its my first time working *professionally*. I started using the following things for the first time

- VSCode Git Client
- Slack
- Jira/ Confluence
- DBeaver / DataGrip

To escape VSCode, I explored the Emacs Church and came across **Magit**. 
I am trying to integrate it in my workflow...

We use nodejs at backend and wish we switch to Golang asap. I have convinced our CTO by banging the advantages of a statically typed language ><

The team at pazy is really helpful. Right from the onboarding call to all the team syncups; it feels like a family.

> The product automatically grows if the team grows.

We are trying to create an wholesome, friendly, fast paced environment.
I can say we sometimes miss robustness in our code but that comes with the expectations from a startup;

For me this is a learning experience. For me it will be amazing to be a *core member* of the engineering-team; but thats a goal & I have no idea what the future looks like.

I really like that the product team is amazing; They hold good deal of power; 
Product and Engineering syncups are always fun.

> If you want to build a good product; get yourself a good product team !

If you rely on the backend team to build websites, you will have a login page like [[this]](https://news.ycombinator.com/login?goto=news)
; Or the one you are reading this blog on :/

Lets talk about sales team; without them what the engineers are building will be just another *side project*. 
I just think they will be the coolest group to hangout with... 

Lets not forget arguably the most important role I think is: <u>Quality Assurance</u>
If they say its **GTG**, you are all well and good; if they aren't satisfied- its time to cut a new branch and start working again.

I was first time introduced to this position; I had no idea about it. Now I think its like the *CDM* position in Football.

CDM is Central Defensive Midfielder; which basically provides the other midfielders and attackers to attack **freely** and provides the **cover** to the defense.

So the QA provides cover to us (Engineering Team) and provides freedom to the Sales Team to brag about the features !

Well thats what I can think of for now. 
I plan to write another blog with a title like *6 months at Pazy*...

Hope you liked it and it was not boring... 

Bye Bye ><
